- What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?

I'd like to tackle the issue of racial and gender bias in facial recognition systems. To start, I will show how a facial recognition system trained from scratch can create bias.

From there, I will demonstrate how open source facial recognition networks exhibit similar bias. I'll analyze the ethical implications and provide suggestions for improvment. 

- Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?

Machine learning tasks, like facial recognition, are increasingly penetrating our lives. It is important that they are sesative to the issues of bias and discrimination.

- What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?

How easy/common is it for a facial recognition system to become biased towards certain races/genders/ethnicites. What factors come into play? Skin color, bone structure, cothing, ect.

- Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (creditability of source, quality of data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?

There are large, open source, repositories of faces that can be used for this purpose. There are also large pretrained networks that can be analyzed for bias. 

- What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis (variables should be tied to the questions in #3)?

I indend to come up with a metric that quantifies a model's level of bias. 

- What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?

Most facial recognition systems are based on CNNs or visual transformers.

- What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practicle applications, etc)?

I hope to shed some light on dicrimination in facial recognition and show, through code, what can be done to mitigate the issue.
